cats are fuzzy,
they're very cute.
they'll meow at times,
but are often mute.

cats can scratch,
they can also bite.
they sleep during the day,
and come alive at night.

cats are active,
they jump on things.
they play with toys,
and little rings.

I love cats,
yes I do.
I love them more than most things,
and you should too.
